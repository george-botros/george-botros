# Hello and Welcome! 👋

I'm George, a passionate and creative computer science student studying at UPenn. I love coding, building cool projects, and exploring new technologies.


## 🚀 Some Cool Projects
### 🎬 Transcript Reader
Enhance your video viewing experience! With this project, I developed a Safari extension and an app for macOS and iPad that takes Safari's "reader mode" to a whole new level by extending it to video subtitles. Now, you can enjoy a comfortable reading experience while watching your favorite videos. But its usefulness extends beyond enabling users to focus on video content: Transcript Reader invites video watchers to select, search, copy, Quick note, and read ahead in the transcript. Popcorn not included!
